# Strathweb Phi Engine

An xcframework for running Microsoft's [Phi-3](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-phi-3-redefining-whats-possible-with-slms/) locally in an iOS app using [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle).

Includes a sample iOS app. Tested on iPad Air M1 (works). Should probably work on 6GB RAM iPhones too.
